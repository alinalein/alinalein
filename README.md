# Hello, Welcome to my GitHub Repositories 👋

I am a freshly certified full-stack developer living all over the world but mostly in Berlin.💚
My coding journey is fueled by a passion for creating user-friendly experiences, and I enjoy being involved in every aspect of building an interactive app from scratch.🔅

Here’s a quick look at how to reach me and what’s been keeping me excited lately:

- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** I’m working with Node.js, API development, and React to improve my skills and advance in the SaaS/FaaS/Fintech industry.
- 🎵 **Interests:**I love exploring new places and challenging myself with activities I haven't tried yet, like skydiving and scuba diving. It's this same curiosity and drive that I bring to my coding projects.
- 📫 **Get in Touch:** Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-leinweber/) or visit my [Website](https://alinalein.github.io/portfolio_beta/) to learn more.

Eager to team up on cutting-edge projects and dive into the latest technologies!👯
